# Voxel World Generation using the Bukkit API 

**A procedural Voxel World generation Minecraft Plugin** 

*NOTE: This is a template for developers to fork and customise rather than a plug-in and play project* 

Below is an example of how terrain can possibly look

## Features
> Intuitive and complex terrain generation

> Logically dispersed biomes; chosen based on characteristics inspired by Vanilla World generation
- Continentalness (how inland)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Weirdness (a parameter used to make biomes more rare)

> Biome Specific World generation
- Generation of trees
- Generation of layers of the world
- Generation of flora and vegetation
- Small features contained to a chunk (for instance a rock)
- Larger schematics using the WorldEdit API can also be placed throughout the world, below are some ideas
  - This could be used to create custom villages for instance
  - Floating sky islands
  - Castles
  - Dungeons
  - Ships on ocean biomes
  

## How it works 
( Inspired by https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/how-to-create-a-custom-world-generator.545616/ )

The plugin uses Perlin noise, through the use of FastNoiseLite (https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite) to generate noise. See a visualiser here https://auburn.github.io/FastNoiseLite/ 

This noise parameter is a value from -1 to 1. Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise meaning it is effective at procedurally generating terrain that looks smooth and appears logical. 

Noise generators can have different parameters passed into them (these can be seen in the visualiser). Through this it is possible to adjust the following:
>
> ### Octaves
> The number of layers of noise that are used to create the fractal
>
> ### Fractal Type
> This controls the style of what the noise looks like, it is best to experiment as they have different use cases, the project mainly uses Fractal Brownian motion except in the case of river generation - done with Ping Pong instead. 
>
> Their effects can be configured through the use of different parameters to achieve the desired end 
>
> ### Lacunarity 
> Simply a measure of the "gappiness". A higher value means more/larger gaps. 
>
> ### Fractal Gain
> The gain between successive octaves


Once a noise function is created, it can be interpreted. In the case of this plugin, a biome category is first chosen based on continentalness.

From there out of the biomes belonging to the category, a score is assigned based on:
  the difference between the target continentalness + the difference between the target temperature + the difference between the target humidity + some arbitrary weirdness function.

Lowest score wins out. 

Caves and rivers are generated by being placed where their corresponding noise functions are above a certain value. 

Chunks are built entirely by iterating through each block and placing blocks at this point. 

Once the noise functions are computed and biomes delegated, blocks are placed and then BlockPopulators are used for trees etc (https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/generator/BlockPopulator.html).
